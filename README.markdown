# platformSelector: a jQuery plugin

platformSelector is a simple jQuery plugin that adds classes to the body
element representing the browser's environment.  It adds classes  parsed
from the user agent string, which generally represents informtaiton such
as browser type, browser version, operating system and rendering engine.

## Usage

There's no need to call a function - just include the plugin and it will
self-execute.

Once installed, you can access the classes via CSS or a script.  For example,
you might want to display some information only to your IE6 users (requesting
they upgrade, perhaps :-).  You could achieve this with the following styles:

  <pre>
    #upgrade { display: none; }
    .ie_6 #upgrade { display: block; }
  </pre>

The plugin is also useful for self-documenting CSS hacks. e.g:

  <pre>
    .panel { margin-left: 0; }
    .ie .panel { margin-left: -5px }
  </pre>
  
### Notes on implementation

Obviously the plugin requires JavaScript be enabled in order to work.  Another
limitation is that the implementation relies on parsing of the user agent
string.  These limitations mean that the plugin is not guaranteed to work in
all cases.  Additionally, new browser versions or platforms may break existing
functionality.

For these reasons, it is recommended that this plugin <em>only</em> be used for
non-critical functionality and minor CSS tweaks (a few pixels here and there)
If you are experiencing a major CSS display bug then you are much better off
finding the root cause of that problem than patching it with this plugin.

### Examples of Classes Added

The plugin attempts to parse both major and full version numbers, which allows
you to target platforms at various levels of granularity.  The class
<code>js</code> is also always added, indicating that JavaScript is enabled.
